minNAZAOSD runs on the cheap (about 20$) MinimOSD hardware and realizes an OSD for the NAZA M V1/V2/Lite flight controller with NAZA GPS.

This project is GNU GPL v3 and using it is at your own risk.

It does not need an additional arduino board as other non-DJI OSD for NAZA.

One MinimOSD hardware with the ATmega 328p and Max 7456 chip is enough. If you like current measurement, you need a current sensor of course.

The only disadvantage: You have to solder and you have to know what you are doing.

Depending on the stage you want to use you need up to some very good soldering skills.

It's based on my other OSD project the minOPOSD: http://code.google.com/p/minoposd/

and on the ArduCamOSD code: http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/

The minNAZAOSD ready soldered, completely connected and mounted in my test-copter:

Here is a flight with the minNAZAOSD firmware showing all features like GPS related stuff, voltage/current stuff, radar, artificial horizon, throttle percentage, screen-switching, LED modus interpreter and - a tractor ;-)

Here is another flight with the minNAZAOSD showing failsafe RTH with auto land, manual mode, ATTI mode, GPS mode and - another tractor ;-)
