# How to compile and flash the code #


How to compile and flash arduino code is documented many times on the web.

A good entry point for how to start with arduino and to compile the code is here: http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage

A good entry point for how to flash the code is here: http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/wiki/Cfg_Update_Firmware

But don't use their hex file of course, but compile the right one for minNAZAOSD.

The code is here:

And use the 'OSD Config Tool' from my code section trunk/Tools, it's the same as of my other project minOPOSD.

If you really need the hex files without compiling for a quick success you can find them here (english forum):

and here (german forum):

But also try to compile it by your own, it's worth the work, you will learn something and not all possibilities are available in the precompiled hex files.
