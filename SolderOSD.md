# How to solder the OSD #

Since I own the old version V0.1 of the MinimOSD with the heating problem, I first of all desoldered the diode to isolate the 12V from the OSD and powered it from the 5V side.

In the following two pictures you can see how to do so.

Shown above is an unsoldered MinimOSD and below a soldered MinimOSD.

Desolder the diode (red rectangle) to isolate the 12V from the OSD.

Solder the two solder jumper (green rectangles) to powered the MAX7456 chip from the 5V side.

The LED adaptor soldering is easy.

The LED adaptor heatshrinked:

The following is the hardest stuff to do for this OSD.

Shown here is the insane version of the minNAZAOSD.

Just decide which version you like and then only do the necessary or none soldering for your choice.

Only do this if you have some very good soldering skills.

Also only do this if you have the knowledge of what you are doing.

For connecting the LED adaptor, the RSSI, the voltage/current sensor and the things for the artificial horizon, screen switching and throttle percentage you have to solder the things shown in blue in the following diagram:

Here are some pictures of one of many ways doing the advanced and insane soldering.

You need this only when you like to use the advanced and/or insane stage of the minNAZAOSD!

I started with the insane soldering and relaxed a little doing the advanced stuff afterwards ;-)

The insane soldering is insane because 3 pins are side by side and the chip has a pin pitch of only 0.8mm.

The advanced soldering is just advanced because the pins are not side by side.

Especially the LED adaptor and RSSI pin is not so advanced because they are at the edge of the chip, almost easy ;-)

Here is the minNAZAOSD ready soldered, completely connected and mounted in my test-copter:
