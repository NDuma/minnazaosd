There are 3 different possible stages for this OSD:

  * easy
  * advanced
  * insane

Just choose the stage you like and have fun.

With that you get the following:

  * Visible Sats
  * GPS Lock
  * GPS Coord
  * Heading Rose
  * Heading
  * Home Direction
  * Home Distance
  * Altitude
  * Home Altitude
  * Climb Rate

With the advanced version you need some advanced soldering at the MinimOSD and an adaptor for the NAZA LED and optionally a voltage/current sensor.

With that you add the following:

  * NAZA LED interpreter
  * Voltage measurement
  * Current measurement
  * RSSI input
