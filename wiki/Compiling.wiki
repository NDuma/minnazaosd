= How to compile and flash the code =


How to compile and flash arduino code is documented many times on the web.

A good entry point is here: http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/wiki/Cfg_Update_Firmware

But don't use their hex file of course, but compile the right one for minRXOSD.

And use the 'OSD Config Tool' from my code section trunk/Tools, it's the same as of my other project minOPOSD.

Before you compile the minRXOSD hex file you can change the layout and the critical percent threshold for your needs by editing the following defines in OSD_Panels.ino:


#define CRITICAL_PERCENT

#define SHOW_MINIMAL

#define PAN_WARN_X

#define PAN_WARN_Y

#define PAN_CHAN_STAT_X

#define PAN_CHAN_STAT_Y

#define PAN_RX_STAT_X

#define PAN_RX_STAT_Y
